              <h1>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h1>

<p>
<blockquote><strong>Are all Hedge Funds hedged?</strong>
<blockquote>No. Not all hedge funds are hedged. Many are simply long stocks, and may even use leverage. One must ascertain on a case by case basis, therefore, whether a fund hedges, how, and how much. This is absolutely crucial to understanding a fund's performance. Without this information, one cannot gauge how much risk produced its return.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote><strong>Are all hedge funds highly aggressive?</strong>
<blockquote> No. This is the greatest misconception regarding hedge funds. Although some funds are aggressive, many other funds emphasize consistency of returns or protection of investors' capital. Recall that hedge funds cover a wide variety of investment strategies including fixed annuities and other conservative strategies.
</blockquote> </blockquote>

<blockquote> <strong> Are there restrictions as to who can invest in Lloyd’s Alternative Asset Management LLC?

<blockquote>Are there restrictions as to who can invest in Lloyd’s Alternative Asset Management LLC?
</blockquote>

<blockquote>1. You have an individual net worth, or you and your spouse have a combined net worth, in excess of $1.5 million. </blockquote>
<blockquote>2. You had individual income, excluding any income attributable to your spouse, of more than $200,000 in the previous two years, and you reasonably expect to do the same this calendar year. </blockquote>

<blockquote>
3. You and your spouse had joint income of more than $300,000 in the previous two years and reasonably expect to do the same in this calendar year. Institutions and pension accounts are subject to more complex criteria, and should consult an accountant.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote><strong>Can a qualified client invest IRA or ERISA assets?</strong>
<blockquote>Usually qualified clients may invest IRA or ERISA assets in hedge funds; however, funds are limited in the amount of these assets they may accept. IRA investments in hedge funds makes a great deal of sense because of the deferral of taxes on capital gains. The details of this deferral should be discussed with an accountant before making an investment.</blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>How many investors may invest in a hedge fund?</strong>
<blockquote>100 "accredited investors" or an unlimited number of "qualified purchasers" may invest in a single Hedge Fund.
</blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>What are 'offshore' hedge funds?
</strong>
<blockquote>Offshore hedge funds are designed to allow non-U.S. citizens to invest in U.S. securities
</blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><strong>What is Lloyd’s Alternative Asset Management LLC’s lock-up period?
</strong>
<blockquote>The lock up period for aggressive fund A will be 4 weeks, 8 weeks for moderate fund B, and 12 weeks for conservative fund C.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>
What does it mean to hedge?</strong>
<blockquote>"Hedging" roughly means managing risk. Typically, a money manager employs a particular hedging technique in order to mitigate a particular type of risk. For instance, market risk - the risk of a decline in the overall market - can be hedged against by selling a broad collection of securities short in equal proportion to one's long exposure. The same end could also be accomplished by buying put options on an index like the S&P500. Other types of risk often hedged against include interest rate, inflation, and large weightings in a sector, region, single company, or currency. Tools and techniques of hedging include: raising cash, selling short, buying or selling options, futures, commodity and/or currency futures, etc.
</blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><strong>What is a hedge fund?</strong>
<blockquote>
Hedge funds are defined by their structure rather than any specific investment method. These pooled investment vehicles are commonly set up as limited partnerships in which the manager acts as the general partner while the investors act as the limited partners. Oddly, the term “hedge fund” is a misnomer. Not all hedge funds are hedged. Hedge funds invest in any number of strategies regardless of the common term that attempts to corral them. These strategies include investing in asset classes such as stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, and return enhancing tools such as leverage, derivatives, and arbitrage. Some funds, however, are simply 100% long equity securities.
</blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>What is a qualified purchaser?</strong>
<blockquote>An investor is a "qualified purchaser" (sometimes referred to as a "super accredited" investor) if the investor is a(n)</blockquote>

<blockquote>* business that has discretion over $25 million or more in investments.</blockquote>

<blockquote>* trust sponsored by qualified purchasers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>* individual who own $5 million or more in investments, including investments held jointly with a spouse.</blockquote>
<blockquote>* family-held business that owns $5 million or more in investments.</blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><strong>What is an accredited investor?</strong><blockquote>Presently, if you can meet one of the following criteria, you are an accredited investor</blockquote>

<blockquote>* You have an individual net worth, or you and your spouse have a combined net worth, in excess of $1 million.</blockquote>


<blockquote>* You had individual income, excluding any income attributable to your spouse, of more than $200,000 in the previous two years, and you reasonably expect to do the same this calendar year. </blockquote>
